    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <b>The Clay Institute</b> was inspired by a set of twenty-three problems
      organized by the mathematician <b>David Hilbert</b> in 1900 which were
      highly influential in driving the progress of mathematics in the twentieth
      century. The seven selected problems range over a number of mathematical
      fields, namely
      <i>
        algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, geometric
        topology, mathematical physics, number theory, partial differential
        equations, and theoretical computer science.
      </i>
      Unlike <b>Hilbert's problems</b>, the problems selected by the
      <b>Clay Institute</b> were already renowned among professional
      mathematicians, with many actively working towards their resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Grigori Perelman</b>, who had begun work on the <b>Poincar√© conjecture</b>
      in the 1990s, released his proof in 2002 and 2003. His refusal of the <b>Clay
        Institute's</b> monetary prize in 2010 was widely covered in the media.
      The other six <strong>Millennium Prize Problems</strong> remain unsolved,
      despite a large number of unsatisfactory proofs by both amateur and
      professional mathematicians.

    <p>
      <b>Andrew Wiles</b>, as part of the <b>Clay Institute</b>'s scientific
      advisory board, hoped that the choice of 1 million prize money would
      popularize, among general audiences, both the selected problems as well as
      the <i>"excitement of mathematical endeavor"</i>. Another board member,
      Fields medalist <b>Alain Connes</b>, hoped that the publicity around the
      unsolved problems would help to combat the <i>"wrong idea"</i> among the
      public that mathematics would be <i>"overtaken by computers"</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some mathematicians have been more critical. <b>Anatoly Vershik</b>
      characterized their monetary prize as <i>"show business"</i> representing
      the <i>"worst manifestations of present-day mass culture"</i>, and thought
      that there are more meaningful ways to invest in public appreciation of
      mathematics. He viewed the superficial media treatments of <b>Perelman</b>
      and his work, with disproportionate attention being placed on the prize
      value itself, as unsurprising. By contrast, <b>Vershik</b> praised the
      <b>Clay Institute's</b> direct funding of research conferences and young
      researchers. <b>Vershik's</b> comments were later echoed by Fields
      medalist <b>Shing-Tung Yau</b>, who was additionally critical of the idea
      of a foundation taking actions to <i>"appropriate"</i> fundamental
      mathematical questions and <i>"attach its name to them"</i>.
